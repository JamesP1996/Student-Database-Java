# Student-Database-Java
Student Database made using Java &lt;Netbeans> and MySQL &lt;WorkBench> , Made a while ago and did not originally make a github for it, so there're wont be many commits but I felt I should upload it now before I lose the Data and my coding effort forever.

I created it in Netbeans using the UI and Event Tools to my advantage and Derby.jar along with some database libaries to allow the integration of MySQL databases into it.
None of the background images in the ui were made by me personally so if you find the original owner's of the images, give them the credit.
The database application made in java is able to connect to mysql and perform the following actions.

1. Display All Students/Courses
2. Search Student/Course
3. Add Student/Course
4. Delete Student/Course
5. Modify Student/Course

Thank you for taking your time to view my first major java project from 2018, 
If you have any questions feel free to message me through my GIT Account.
